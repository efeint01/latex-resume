# Resume Styles

Hello everyone, in this repository you can find 2 different resume style. One of them prepared on LaTeX and I am using that style right now. Other one is the resume style that got me accepted into the Siemens internship, Mercedes-Benz internship and Mercedes-Benz Software Engineering role.

I have edited them with quiet understandable explanations. Feel free to use any style. And good luck on your job searching journey.
